Here is an unequivocal answer from a guy who has two masters degree - go for the job.

Masters ideally is a specialization. Either you probably do not know what you want to specialize on, or you do. There can be four scenarios:


Scenario 1:  If you don't know your calling, then the work stint will help you find one. 

If you do know what you want to focus on, then congratulations. Those years at work will help you identify your calling.  

Scenario 2: If you find no more pull for masters- then you saved some years. 

Scenario 3: If you find the pull for masters, but for a different subject- then you have utilized those years. 

Scenario 4: Even after a few years, you still have a yearn for the MS for the same subject. Then you "lost the years somewhat" ( clarification later).

You can see, taking the job results in better outcome in three out of four scenarios. So 75% chance that you will be better off taking the job.

Clarification of "lost the years somewhat": The scenario 4 is not totally worthless even if If you do not want to go to an academic career. You will get experience and contacts that will help you get placed better after your masters. You will save money that will support you with less reliance on TA/RA-ship. Both these advantages will enable you concentrate on your studies more and get more from the program. 

Net-net, there is some advantages for choosing the job even if you end up in scenario 4. So I would say there is a 75%+ chance that you will end up at a better outcome by choosing to join a job.
